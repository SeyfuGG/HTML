    <h2>How HTML works</h2>
    <p style="text-align: center">
      HTML is a text file containing specific syntax, file and naming
      conventions that show the computer and the web server that it is in HTML
      and should be read as such. By applying these HTML conventions to a text
      file in virtually any text editor, a user can write and design a basic
      webpage, and then upload it to the internet. The most basic of HTML
      conventions is the inclusion of a document type declaration at the
      beginning of the text file. This always comes first in the document,
      because it is the piece that affirmatively informs a computer that this is
      an HTML file. The document header typically looks like this: &lt;!DOCTYPE
      html&gt;. It should always be written that way, without any content inside
      it or breaking it up. Any content that comes before this declaration will
      not be recognized as HTML by a computer. Doctypes are not just used for
      HTML, they can apply to the creation of any document that uses SGML
      (Standard Generalized Markup Language). SGML is a standard for specifying
      a specific markup language being used. HTML is one of several markup
      languages that SGML and doctype declarations apply to.
